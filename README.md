# Samply Broker UI Material Prototype

This project contains a prototype of a Samply Broker UI which uses [Material Design][1] as basis. Besides that this prototype tries to showcase the following:

* full use of frontend technologies and build tools based on [npm][2] and [webpack][3]
* carried out as [SPA][4] which runs in the browser and connects to backend services like the MDR
* build with [Elm][5] a pure functional and typed language for the browser
* Docker based build for a maximum of reproducibility and independence from different environments
* customizable at deploy time through environment variables

## Usage

To start the UI including the search store which is needed to persist the searches, this project contains a Docker compose file with the complete setup. 

Clone this Git repository, if you haven't already:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexanderkiel/samply.broker.ui.material.git
```

Make sure you have port 8080 free or edit the `docker-compose.yml` before brining the system up with:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Point your browser to: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Environment

The Docker container needs certain environment variables to be able to run:

* SEARCH_STORE_ROOT - the base URI of the search store
* MDR_ROOT - the base URI of the Samply MDR to use
* MDR_NAMESPACE - the namespace of the MDR to use

## Build

The build is Docker based. Just run:

```bash
docker build .
```

## Development

* install [npm][2]
* run `npm install` to install the required node packages
* run the search store on port 8080: `docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PORT="8080" -e DATABASE_URI="datomic:mem://store" akiel/samply.broker.ui.material:latest`
* run `npm run dev` to run an interactive development environment with hot reloading
* open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Search Store API

The search store API is modeled after the [CQRS][6] pattern. There is one 
command endpoint, accepting all the writes and several REST-like query endpoints
for the reads.

Command results only contain a sync token and an optional identifier. After issuing a command, the sync token is used to sync with the read side, so that we can be sure to see our own effects. One example is the `search/create` command which creates a new search. After creating the search, the UI navigates to the search page which displays it. The result of the `search/create` command is the search identifier and a sync token which is used in the subsequent read request of the search created.
