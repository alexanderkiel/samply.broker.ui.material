# Samply Broker UI Material Prototype

This project contains a prototype of a Samply Broker UI which uses [Material Design][1] as basis. Besides that this prototype tries to showcase the following:

* full use of frontend technologies and build tools based on [npm][2] and [webpack][3]
* carried out as [SPA][4] which runs in the browser and connects to backend services like the MDR
* build with [Elm][5] a pure functional and typed language for the browser
* Docker based build for a maximum of reproducibility and independence from different environments
* customizable at deploy time through environment variables

## Usage

To start the UI including the search store which is needed to persist the searches, this project contains a Docker compose file with the complete setup.
